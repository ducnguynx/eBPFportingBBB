# eBPFportingBBB
A project with the final target as a custom-made OS based on 5.10 Linux mainline kernel, natively supports eBPF for Beagle Bone Black
## Building the kernel
**THIS PROJECT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BOARDS OTHER THAN THE BEAGE BONE BLACK REV C**
For learning purpose, I **will build everything from scratch**, maybe I'll make a version using Buildroot & Yocto, so stay tuned :)
### Requirements
#### 1.Toolchain from [crosstool-NG](https://crosstool-ng.github.io/)
#### 2.A working bootloader (U-Boot based would be preferred)
